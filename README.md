# simple-weather-application
Simple react typescript application that uses a REST API 

It uses the 'OpenWeatherMap' API to get weather information.
The user enters the location information through the input box.
When the search input box is not empty, Material UI spinner is turned on.
And the weather results is displayed if the location is valid.
Otherwise returns an alert box to notify the user of the invalid location or broken API.

The application utilises a docker.
And the docker image is used to deploy to an Azure Web App
